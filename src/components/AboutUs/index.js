            Will your child graduate from high school or college with all the
            skills needed to get and keep a job ? Many parents look to educators
            to prepare their children for the workplace. Teaching soft skills is
            more important than ever before.

              For years, hiring managers have long been reporting a lack of soft
              skills in recent graduates. Research conducted in 2018 with
              Fortune 500 CEOs by the Stanford Research Institute International
              and the Carnegie Melon Foundation, found that 75% of long-term job
              success depends on people skills. Only 25% depended on job-related
              skills.Curiosity Quotient and Emotional Quotient are vital in life, yet
              the official education system predominantly concentrates on IQ.
